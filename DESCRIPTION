Description: Provides VRT (virtual raster) versions of data sources in raadtools. VRT augments data sources that don't provide 
 sufficient metadata, common cases include missing geotransform, projection string, and array orientation. VRT can be used to 
 rectify/augment these missing pieces while avoid any explicit data reformatting, and a VRT string can be passed as a source
 to GDAL's 'warping' machinery for reprojection, reading at scale, and subsetting. VRT can be created for any given file or 
 subdataset, but because the numbers of files can be large we store them parameterized and generate on demand in various ways for
 different time steps and subdatasets.
